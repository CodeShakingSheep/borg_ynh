This app has gone through a major revamp!

If you have multiple instances of this app, one upgrade will break all instances. You need to
upgrade all apps. This is the last time it happens.

Also, developer aren't flawless and we might have missed something during our tests.
Please, PLEASE, check in a few days that backups are being done properly.

If you want to manually check backups, run this:

```bash
systemctl start borg
```

Or, for a single app, for example Nextcloud:

```bash
sudo yunohost backup create --apps nextcloud --methods borg_app
```

If you find *any* issue or have a doubt, feel free to contact the devs on Github or Matrix.

Backups are important. In any case, check your backups regularly.
