## Overview

A [Borg](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#what-is-borgbackup) integration to backup your YunoHost server to another remote server (e.g. one of your friends).

It works This is the Borg Backup App to be installed on a server to backup. It works in combination with the [Borg Server App](https://apps.yunohost.org/app/borgserver) installed on a host server.

### Features

- Backup on a remote machine, in comination with the [borg server app](https://apps.yunohost.org/app/borgserver)
- ... or on a [commercial borg service](https://www.borgbackup.org/support/commercial.html)
- Backups are encrypted (the remote server can't read the content) and deduplicated (optimize space)
- Backups are ran automatically, you can choose when and at which frequency
- You can choose what apps are backuped
- Receive email alerts if the backup fails (the [borg server app](https://apps.yunohost.org/app/borgserver) also checks that new content arrives and send an email to your friend otherwise)

### Install procedure

Maybe counter-intuitively, you should *first* install this app (`borg_ynh`) and *then* (`borgserver_ynh`) on the other machine. In fact, after the install of `borg_ynh`, a message should be displayed with the info, in particular the SSH public key, to be used to setup `borgserver_ynh` on the other machine.
